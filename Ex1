Exp:1 IMPLEMENTATION OF CAESER CIPHER

AIM:
To encrypt and decrypt the given message by using Caeser Cipher encryption algorithm.

ALGORITHM:
1.	Calculate the length of the plaintext.
2.	For each character in the plaintext:
a.	Add the key to the character to get the cipher character.
b.	If the result exceeds 'Z' for uppercase or 'z' for lowercase, subtract 26 to wrap within the alphabet.
3.	Display the encrypted text.
4.	For decryption, subtract the key from each character of the ciphertext.
a.	If the result is less than 'A' for uppercase or 'a' for lowercase, add 26 to wrap within the alphabet.
5.	Display the decrypted text.

PROGRAM:

OUTPUT:

RESULT:
The program implementing the Caesar cipher for encryption and decryption has been successfully executed, and the results have been verified.
